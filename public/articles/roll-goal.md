Learning game engine development, I wanted to **compare the philosophy** of the popular tools already available on the market. In order to do so, the game needed to be complex enough in order to try out the features of each engine, but also quite small in its scope so that I could make it in an acceptable time-frame.

Roll Goal is a mini-game feature in The legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess once you reach the fishing stand. It is a simple and yet very fun game to play.
