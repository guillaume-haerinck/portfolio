A crazy web experience powered by Webpack and HTML Components in Vanilla Javascript. It all started from this question : what if we achieved to make our teacher believe that we made his PC crash through a website ? In order to do so, it was crucial to push him to use the website in fullscreen, but it needed to be subtile enough so that he stayed immersed in the experience. 

From this we grown the idea into "Coffee conspiration", a website made by a conspirationist which believes that extraterrestrials invented the coffee to mind-control the people. A great way to **test out many unrelated web-based techniques**. If you find it intriguing please [go try it](https://coffee-conspiration.guillaumehaerinck.com/) because spoilers are coming below.
