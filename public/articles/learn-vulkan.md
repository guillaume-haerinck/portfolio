Vulkan API being so low level, I wanted to make an **easy-to-understand project** where I could come back to from time to time when I needed a reminder about its inner working. (a similar project was made with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guillaumehaerinck.com/#/project-detail/dx11-playground">DirectX 11 using an ECS architecture</a>).

What is new compared to the tutorials ? I rely on the C++ API instead of the C one which does many more compile-time safety checks. The code is architecture with Objects relationship in mind to be easy to understand and not performant. And last thing is that I use HLSL shaders compiled to Spir-V instead of GLSL.
