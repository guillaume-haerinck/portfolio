This project is an experimentation with different goals in mind. The first was to get more familiar with DirectX 11 design by implementing multiple rendering techniques. I also wanted to see how the **Entity Component System** architecture could fit inside of a renderer, and finally I wanted to make an abstraction to the API so that I could switch between OpenGL and DirectX at runtime (the [OpenGL playground](https://www.guillaumehaerinck.com/#/project-detail/opengl-playground) project is similar to this but smaller in its scope).

I write this description with a year of delay from my last commit, a year where I could learn more about software architecture, and where I discovered that ideas I found clever in this project could also become anti-patterns. Let's review this together.
