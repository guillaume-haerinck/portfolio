This project is an experimentation with different goals in mind. The first was to get more familiar with DirectX 11 design by implementing multiple rendering techniques. I also wanted to see how the **Entity Component System** architecture could fit inside of a renderer, and finally I wanted to make an abstraction to the API so that I could switch between OpenGL and DirectX at runtime (the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.guillaumehaerinck.com/#/project-detail/opengl-playground">OpenGL playground</a> project is similar to this but smaller in its scope).
