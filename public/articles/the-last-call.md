From an original scenario that we written, we created **a title-sequence** to present the cast of the movie. Seing the incredible results obtained with the Quixel Megascan library - like the [Rebirth short movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fC20NWhx4) - we decided to use Unreal Engine to see what we could obtain from it.

To create our sequence, we took and modified some CC0 models online, but we decided to **model and rig** our main actor.

## Robot modelling

Looking through Pinterest, we found a robot design : ["red tribe robot" by SpaceCowsmith](http://spacecowsmith.blogspot.com/2012/05/mcm-preview-5-red-tribe-robot.html) which looked awesome for our goal. We modelled and rigged everything in Blender, taking our time to create a **good topology** that would be easier to animate.

We then took the model onto Substance Painter to do the texturing. We followed some tutorials made by [Flipped Normals](https://www.youtube.com/user/FlippedNormalsTuts), and achieved to make our own **smart materials** and other believable layers onto our model. It is not perfect, but a fair first try.

## Level design and Animations

From our storyboard, we exported low-poly models into Unreal Engine to set our scene. We put camera movements, bare animation retargeted from Mixamo, and some basic lighting. Once that we were happy with the result we started to replace everything with high-quality assets to get the final result.  

## Conclusion

Used to video-editing tool, I was impressed by the power of the Unreal sequencer : creating animated shots and putting them together was really enjoyable. I also loved to see a model I created be animated on screen to have its own stor. It is an exercice that I would love to tackle again.
