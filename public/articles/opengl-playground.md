This project is an experimentation to see how the **Entity Component System** architecture would fit OpenGL state-machine design (a similar project was made with [DirectX 11](https://www.guillaumehaerinck.com/#/project-detail/dx11-playground). I write this description with a fresh eye as one year as passed from my last commit, so I am able to criticize my work with the help of my new experience in software engineering.

[More description coming soon]
