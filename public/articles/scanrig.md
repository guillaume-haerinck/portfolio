This project aim is to make more **accessible, automated and easy the capture of an object** in all of its angles. The pictures generated are then used with a photogrammetry software like [Meshroom](https://alicevision.org/#meshroom) to **create a 3D model**. We worked as [IMAC students](https://www.ingenieur-imac.fr/) in collaboration with [AliceVision](https://alicevision.org/) to make this prototype happen.

## How it works

There are 3 cameras attached to an arm. This arm is rotating around a static objects. **While the arm is moving we capture photos**. There is a software built with QT to handle the cameras and the engine setting. We also built custom lighting to **allow the use of photometry** and create normal maps of the object, in this setup, the arm will wait at the 4 cardinal angles in order to take pictures while the lighting setup updates.

## My roles

- Created a C++ library (with a python wrapper) to handle any kind of Camera on Windows and on Linux,
- Modelled the various versions of the Rig with Fusion360,
- Helped making the QT software to pilot everything,
- Made various technical tests to check the camera capabilities,
- Cut holes, saw wood and many other things to create the prototype.

## Conclusion

Working on a prototype is an exiting journey as you have to be both a bit crazy to find ideas but plan everything ahead so that you reduce the amount of problem to overcome. I particularly enjoyed the two roles of being a developer but also a maker and have to assemble pieces together.
